# ai03 inpired macropad pcb
My attempt at learning and implementing ai03's guide to pcb design for keyboards. The aim of this project is to design and manufacture a simple 3by3 MX style macropad pcb, which actuall works. The pcb can then be manufactured and either assembled by hand or by the manufacturer if they provide assembly service.

## Project requirements:

- 9 1U switches (mx style)
- USB-C support
- ATmega32xxxx MC (TBD)
- QMK support
- VIA support (TBD)
- Solder support (rev. A)
- Hotswap support (Rev. B)

## CAD
KiCad 5.1.9 is used for the pcb design, based on [ai03's guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design).

**Required KiCad libraries:**
- [ai03's KiCad Type-C library](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Type-C.pretty)
- (TBD)

Autocad, Rhino and Fusion 360 are used for the case design.
